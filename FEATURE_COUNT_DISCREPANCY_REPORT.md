# Feature Count Discrepancy Report

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL FINDING**: The notebook claims to use **348 audio features** for genre classification, but the actual feature count is only **78 features**.

## Actual Feature Breakdown

### Simple Numerical Features: 14
1. duration
2. tempo
3. spec_centroid_mean
4. spec_centroid_std
5. spec_bandwidth_mean
6. spec_bandwidth_std
7. spec_rolloff_mean
8. spec_rolloff_std
9. zero_crossing_mean
10. zero_crossing_std
11. rms_mean
12. rms_std
13. beat_count
14. beat_tempo

### Array-Based Features: 64
- **mfcc_mean**: 20 values
- **mfcc_std**: 20 values
- **chroma_mean**: 12 values
- **chroma_std**: 12 values

**TOTAL: 14 + 64 = 78 features**

## Features That Were Expected But NOT FOUND
The code attempts to extract these features but they don't exist in the CSV:
- chroma_cens_mean (12 values)
- chroma_cens_std (12 values)
- chroma_cqt_mean (12 values)
- chroma_cqt_std (12 values)
- chroma_stft_mean (12 values)
- chroma_stft_std (12 values)
- mel_spectrogram_mean (128 values)
- mel_spectrogram_std (128 values)

**Missing features total: 324 features**

## Where "348" Appears in Notebook
**Location**: Section 5.1 (Model Selection and Mathematical Foundations)

### Incorrect Statement Found:
```
"This analysis addresses a **supervised multi-class classification** problem 
where the goal is to predict which of **20 genre families** a music track 
belongs to, based solely on its **348 audio features** extracted from 
30-second preview clips."
```

### Also in Problem Formulation:
```
- **Feature vectors**: $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{348}$ (audio features: 
  MFCC, chroma, spectral, mel spectrogram)

Objective:
- Learn a function $f: \mathbb{R}^{348} \rightarrow \{0, 1, ..., 19\}$ that 
  accurately predicts genre labels for unseen tracks
```

## Why This Matters
1. **Academic Integrity**: Incorrect feature dimensionality misrepresents the actual model complexity
2. **Mathematical Accuracy**: All equations reference $\mathbb{R}^{348}$ which is wrong
3. **Reproducibility**: Anyone attempting to reproduce this work will find discrepancies
4. **Feature List Claims**: The mention of "mel spectrogram" features is misleading since they're not actually used

## Sections That Need Correction
1. **Section 5.1**: Update all references from 348 to 78
2. **Section 5.1.1**: Change $\mathbb{R}^{348}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{78}$
3. **Section 5.1.1**: Remove "mel spectrogram" from feature list (not present)
4. **Section 5.2, 5.3, 5.4**: Any mathematical notation using 348 dimensions

## Verification Steps Performed
1. ✓ Loaded actual CSV file: `audio_features_with_genres.csv`
2. ✓ Checked all column names for numerical features
3. ✓ Verified which array-based features exist
4. ✓ Counted actual feature dimensions
5. ✓ Read notebook markdown to find incorrect claims
6. ✓ Searched for "348" references in notebook

## Recommended Action
**IMMEDIATE**: Update Section 5.1 to correctly state:
- **78 audio features** (not 348)
- Feature list: MFCC (40 values), Chroma (24 values), Spectral features (8 values), Rhythmic features (6 values)
- Update all mathematical notation from $\mathbb{R}^{348}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{78}$
- Remove mention of mel spectrogram features
